<h1>Homework 5: Basic leaflet map</h1>

<h3>Instructions: Create a webmap with three markers over UNC.</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Watch the <a href="../pages/section3.html#C1">tutorial videos</a> on how to create a leaflet map.</li>
    <li>Create a leaflet webmap that works from GitHub and has the following components:
        <ul>
            <li>3 markers, each with a different icon and a popup.</li>
            <li>The popup must have both text and an image related to the location, and it canâ€™t be related to the UNC well.</li>
            <li>The background basemap should be a tile layer other than OSM or ESRI</li>
        </ul>
        Be sure it works from any computer connected to the internet.
    </li>
</ul>

    <h3>What will you turn in before the deadline?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>On Sakai upload the link to your webmap before the deadline for Homework 5.  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Rubric:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Three markers (3pt) with an icon (3pt) and a popup with text and image related to the location(6pt). </li>
<li>A tile layer other than OSM or ESRI.(2pt) </li>
<li>20% will be deducted per day for late submissions, and 50% will be deducted if it only works locally.</li>
<li>Bonus (3pts)
    <ul>
        <li>Add a line vector</li>
        <li>Add a polygon </li>
        <li>Make each marker a different color</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<!--
For the second component (25%), you will search for historical USGS image data, use QGIS to georeference the image data and to create and edit vector data, and Leaflet to present this data in a map comparing historical and current imagery. The requirements for this project are described in the webmap rubric on Sakai assignments. You will publish your map using GitHub and present it to the class in a three-minute presentation.
The deadline to submit the project is Tuesday June 16 at 11:55pm. -->
